This repository is my exploration and visualizations of the [tidytuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2025/2025-06-24/readme.md) dataset for June 24, 2025. 

I used python version 3.10.16.

1. Install all dependencies
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

2. Review the story.ipynb file for an interesting finding.

3. Run ```python ./altair_vis.py``` and view the resulting html file for an interactive visualization.

All data should download automatically. If you run into any problems review the dataset link above and download to the root directory.
